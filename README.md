# Arduino Uno GAS Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a gas sensor with an Arduino Uno to detect the presence of gases in the environment. The sensor's analog output is read by the Arduino, and the system determines if the gas concentration exceeds a predefined threshold. If it does, a message is printed to the serial monitor indicating gas detection.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Gas Sensor (e.g., MQ-2, MQ-3, MQ-5)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Gas Sensor to Arduino Uno:**
   - **VCC Pin:** Connect to 5V on the Arduino Uno.
   - **GND Pin:** Connect to GND on the Arduino Uno.
   - **Analog Output Pin:** Connect to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Uno.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the gas sensor to the Arduino Uno as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the serial monitor output displaying "Gas detected!" when the sensor value exceeds the threshold (300) and "No gas detected." otherwise. The sensor value will also be printed for reference.

#### Applications

- **Safety Systems:** Use for detecting hazardous gases in industrial or domestic environments.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Implement in systems for monitoring air quality.
- **Prototyping:** Useful for testing gas detection in various projects.

#### Notes

- Ensure the gas sensor is correctly connected to the Arduino Uno and powered.
- Adjust the threshold value in the code (`const int threshold = 300;`) based on your specific sensor and application requirements.
- Allow the gas sensor to preheat according to the manufacturer's instructions for accurate readings.
